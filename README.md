# Skip App

This is a super small microsite that basically justs acts as a gateway to [https://archive.ph/](https://archive.ph/) which in turn can sometimes help render certain websites a lot more visible.

It works in four ways:

- Simple static website with a search bar - allows pasting in a url and getting redirected
- Javascript bookmarklet - can be saved to bookmarks then clicked from any url
- PWA app - can be saved to phone to access website as an installed app
  - Also acts as a "Share target" allowing the user to share the url to the app and be redirected with only 2 clicks
